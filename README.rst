Usage
~~~~~

.. code:: sh

| Argument | Description                                                      |
+==========+==================================================================+
| SAVE     |  Filename for the returned MPEG movie of the generated           |
|          |  animation. Given filename needs to have the extension mp4/MP4.  |
|          |  Animation is shown in window in the absence of this switch.     |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CONFIG   |  Filename for the given configuration file. The given file       |
|          |  should be in YAML format with the extension yml/YML. This       |
|          |  file can be generated using the --save switch. Defaults are     |
|          |  used in the absence of this switch.                             |

|          |  populated with default values. Use without other switches.      |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Open a window to showing boids animation using the default values:

.. code:: sh

    boids

Create and save a MP4 movie (boids.mp4) of the boids animation:

.. code:: sh

    boids --save boids.mp4

Generate a configuration files (conf.yml) populated with the default
settings:

.. code:: sh

    boids --generate conf.yml

Using a modified configuration file (conf.yml) and override the
defaults:

.. code:: sh

    boids --config conf.yml
